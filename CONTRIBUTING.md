## How to contribute

Open an issue on Github if you've found a problem with the project or have a question.

Submit a PR on Github to propose changes. Before doing so make sure that linter results are clean and tests are passing.

Before running any checks, make sure to install the project with the test dependencies:

```
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[test]" \
  --index https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu -vv
```

## How to test Intel® plugin for TorchCodec

At the moment Intel® Plugin for [TorchCodec] uses patched TorchCodec tests. To setup the testing environment, run:

```
export TORCHCODEC_XPU_PATH=$TORCHLIB_XPU_PATH/packages/torchcodec-xpu/
git clone https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchcodec.git && cd torchcodec
git am $TORCHCODEC_XPU_PATH/patches/0001-Add-XPU-support-to-tests.patch
```

The patch file can be reviewed [here](packages/torchcodec-xpu/patches/0001-Add-XPU-support-to-tests.patch).

TorchCodec tests require some additional packages. Install them as follows:

```
uv pip install torchvision \
  --index https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
```

Execute the tests with:

```
cd torchcodec && pytest test/
```

If tests are flooding the tmpfs, consider to prune pytest directory or use other location:

```
sudo rm -rf /tmp/pytest-of-$(whoami)
# or run as
pytest --basetemp=$HOME/tmp test/
```

Some of the TorchCodec tests require FFmpeg with enabled CPU audio and video decoders and encoders. New versions of TorchCodec might require more FFmpeg codecs to be enabled. If you self-build FFmpeg, consider to configure all codecs required by TorchCodec to reduce number of reported errors on a test run. Note that some of the codecs are GPL licensed. At the moment the following FFmpeg configuration is known to be required to pass TorchCodec tests:

```
# Install prerequisites (Ubuntu)
apt-get install \
    libaom-dev \
    libmp3lame-dev \
    libx264-dev \
    libx265-dev \
    libva-dev \
    libvpx-dev

./configure \
    --prefix=$HOME/_install \
    --libdir=$HOME/_install/lib \
    --disable-static \
    --disable-stripping \
    --disable-doc \
    --enable-shared \
    --enable-vaapi \
    --enable-libmp3lame \
    --enable-gpl \
    --enable-libaom \
    --enable-libx264 \
    --enable-libx265 \
    --enable-libvpx
```

## Tips

### oneAPI compatibility

Use the following compatibility table when self-building the project and its dependencies:

| PyTorch | Torchvision | oneAPI         |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 2.14    | 0.29        | [2026.1][2-14] |
| 2.13    | 0.28        | [2026.0][2-13] |
| 2.12    | 0.27        | [2025.3][2-12] |
| 2.11    | 0.26        | [2025.3][2-11] |
| 2.10    | 0.25        | [2025.3][2-10] |
| 2.9     | 0.24        | [2025.2][2-9]  |
| 2.8     | 0.23        | [2025.1][2-8]  |

PyTorch 2.14 headers require C++20. Keep both plugin CMake projects and their
native targets on C++20 when building against this stack.
