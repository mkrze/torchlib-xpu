"""Launch-size regression tests for the jagged SYCL kernels.

DPC++ is compiled with ``-fsycl-id-queries-fit-in-int``, so ``queue::submit``
throws "Provided range and/or offset does not fit in int" once the flattened
work-item count of a launch exceeds INT32_MAX. Two places cap the work-group
count against that limit: ``check_shape_and_partition_``, for the dense-output
path, and ``FBGEMM_XPU_JAGGED_OUTPUT_INVOKE_BODY``, which re-derives the count
from ``nnz``. Both rely on the kernel's group-stride loop to cover the rows the
smaller launch drops.

Which D reaches each cap follows from the inner extent. ``threads_x`` is
``ceil(D / 2)`` capped at ``kThreadGroupSize``, so it never exceeds D, and the
flattened count is close to the operand's ``numel``. Close, but not bounded by
it: the work-group count is rounded up to a whole multiple of ``threads_y``, so
the launch spans ``roundup(rows, threads_y) * threads_x`` work-items against a
``numel`` of ``rows * D``. The slack is up to ``(threads_y - 1) * threads_x``.

* **Jagged-output path** (``dense_to_jagged_forward``,
  ``jagged_dense_elementwise_add_jagged_output``,
  ``jagged_to_padded_dense_backward``) builds ``packed_accessor32``
  unconditionally, so ``numel`` cannot pass INT32_MAX - ATen raises first. Its
  cap is reachable anyway, but only at **D = 1**, the one width where
  ``threads_x == D`` and so the round-up slack is all that separates the launch
  from ``numel``: at ``nnz = 2**31 - 31``, ``numel`` is a legal 2147483617 while
  the uncapped launch is exactly 2**31. Every wider D has
  ``threads_x / D <= 1 / 2``, which leaves the launch a factor of two below a
  legal ``numel`` - far more than the slack can close. So the three tests below
  run at D = 1.
* **Dense-output path** (``jagged_to_padded_dense_forward``) falls back to
  ``packed_accessor64`` above the limit, so ``numel`` is unbounded and its cap
  fires at any D. ``test_jagged_to_padded_dense_forward_large_grid`` covers it at
  the smallest D that saturates ``threads_x``, which keeps the allocation as
  small as the limit allows.

The shape the jagged-output cap was first reported against is not the shape used
here. That report predates commit 5f977a5, which replaced CUDA's
``inner_dense_size >= kWarpSize / 2 ? kWarpSize : inner_dense_size`` with the
pair-derived ``ceil(D / 2)``:

    D = 16, nnz = 67,108,833, bf16
      CUDA geometry     threads_x = 32  ->  2**31 work-items   (submit threw)
      current geometry  threads_x =  8  ->  2**29 work-items   (4x under)

So the original shape runs clean today and would pass with or without the cap.
Reaching the limit at D = 16 now needs nnz ~ 268M, or ~16 GiB for ``x_values``
alone; D = 1 reproduces the same 2**31 launch in ~4 GiB, so that is what the
tests below use.

Each test is skipped unless the device has enough free memory; the smallest shape
that trips either limit needs multi-gigabyte operands.
